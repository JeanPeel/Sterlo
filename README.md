## About this project

This project includes a portfolio of Sterlo's current Music, and school projects.  At the end of the year his Charter School has him make a presentation to display all that he has learned through out the year.  This presentation is included on the portfolio.  Also each year the charter school has the students work on one large project.  The project Sterlo worked on was writing a song and making a music video which is also included in the page.

## Tech Used
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* CSS

## Details of App and Challenges
I used percentages to define the sizes of items in the CSS file.  But the layout of the page is not showing well in all sizes.  I will want to do some media calls in the future to improve the general flexibality of the page.

The Gallery is not adjusting to the size of the window.  In the future I would like to remake the gallery and have it be more responsive.
